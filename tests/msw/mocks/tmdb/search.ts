Then in "A Star is Burns" Springfield hosts its own film festival (with guest critic Jay Sherman in attendance). The competition boils down to Barney\'s haunting cinema verité short about the horrors of alcohol or Mr Burns grandiose vanity project.  "22 Short Films About Springfield" is a series of parodies within a parody featuring Springfield\'s secondary characters, including Milhouse\'s dad and Chief Wiggum in a glorious Pulp Fiction sequence. Finally, the show\'s own internal parody cartoon duo hit the big screen in "The Itchy and Scratchy Movie", while Bart and Homer lock horns about going to see it. They sell Soylent Green in the future cinema foyer; and Homer loves it, of course.',

			overview:
				"Four more adventures with everyone's favourite dysfunctional animated family. In 'The Regina Monologues', when Bart finds $1000, Lisa is able to convince him to take the family on vacation and they choose to visit England. In '30 Minutes Over Tokyo', after learning how to save money on everything, the Simpson family manages to make it to Tokyo. In 'Blame It On Lisa', when Lisa sheepishly admits that she's been making long-distance calls to Brazil in aid of an orphan she's sponsoring, the whole family decides to head to Rio for a visit. Finally, in 'Simpsons Safari', tired of constant mistreatment, the bag boys of Springfield go on strike, creating a grocery shortage. Homer's frantic search for food in the house uncovers lost gold in the attic which he uses to take the family on safari in Africa.",
